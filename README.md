## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains the data and code required to replicate analyses in Renzi et al. (in prep). This dataset was collected as part of a 13-month long experiment in Moorea, French Polynesia examining the effects of nutrient enrichment on coral mutualists and coral health, which ran from 2021-2022. In the experiment we exposed *Pocillopora* coral colonies (~20 cm diameter) to one of four treatments:

| Treatment        | Description           | Number of coral colonies  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Control      | No manipulation | 10 |
| Nutrient      | Slow-release nitrate fertilizer added      |   10 |
| Crab | Pair of heterosexual *T. bidentata* crabs added at the start of the experiment      |    10 |
| Both | Nitrate fertilizer and a pair of *T. bidentata* crabs added      |    10 |

All corals were cleared of exosymbionts before the start of the experiment. Nutrient treatments consisted of 200 g of polymer-coated potassium nitrate (Multicote 12-0-44, Haifa Chemicals Ltd), which we refreshed every ~3 months. Water samples taken near diffusers confirmed the water coming out of diffusers were enriched. Crab treatments were not maintained and if crabs left colonies they were not replaced. Coral colonies (represented in the dataset using coral_ids 1-40) were blocked so that blocks ran perpendicular to the net flow direction to account for any recruitment shadows. Each block contained all 4 treatments in a random order (see schematic below, with rectangles representing a coral colony in a given treatment; Figure S1 in the associated manuscript). Coral #25 experienced 100% mortality during the experiment and is omitted from most analyses.

### Permitting

All research was based out of the University of California Gump Research Station and conducted on the north shore of Moorea, a volcanic island in the Society Islands archipelago. Research was completed under permits issued by the Territorial Government of French Polynesia (Délégation à la Recherche) and the Haut-Commissariat de la République en Polynésie Francaise (DTRT). Coral tissue samples were transported under the Convention sur le commerce international des espèces de flore et de faune sauvages menaces d’extinction (CITES) export permit FR2198700097-E.

# Data files

## File: exosymbionts.csv

*Exosymbiont taxa abundances*

**Description:** Abundance of exosymbiont (e.g., crabs, shrimp, fish, snails) taxa that were present on coral colonies at the end of 13 months. Taxa groups are by family except for the following taxa, which we left in the following broader taxa groups:
- Amphipods (order Amphipoda)
- Bivalves (class Bivalvia)
- Brittle stars (class Ophiuroidea)
- Hermit crabs (superfamily Paguroidea)
- Limpets 
- Tanaids (order Tanaidacea)
- Worms (i.e., polychaetes, annelids, nemerteans, and sipunculids) 

#### Variables

* coral_id: Unique coral colony identifier used in the experiment. Coral identifiers range from 1-40 and are consistent across datasets (numeric; 1-40)
* taxa_group: The name of the taxa group associated with a count (e.g., Alpheidae, Palaemonidae, Muricidae, Gobidae, Amphipods, etc.) (string)
* abundance: Number of individuals counted within a taxa group for a coral (integer)

## File: metadata.csv

*Metadata associated with each coral colony*

**Description:** Information about coral colonies (e.g., volume, block, treatment) as well as information on key exosymbionts associated with that colony. Key exosymbionts include: 
- *Trapezia bidentata*, the mutualistic crab we used in experimental treatments (we surveyed abundances of *T. bidentata* after 1 month and 13 months of experimental treatments)
- *Dascyllus flavicaudus*, a coral mutaulist associated with improved aeration, reduced sedimentation, and beneficial nutrient excretions 
- *Galeropsis monodonta*, a coral parasite that feeds on coral tissue

#### Variables

* coral_id: Unique coral colony identifier used in the experiment. Coral identifiers range from 1-40 and are consistent across datasets (numeric; 1-40)
* block: Block or row that the coral colony belongs to (see schematic above). Blocks run parallel to the reef crest and all four treatments are represented randomly within each block (numeric; 1-10)
* treatment: Description of the coral colony's treatment assignment. Options are Control, Crab, Nutrient, or Both (string)
* crab: Whether we added *T. bidentata* to that colony (Y = yes, N = no). All Crab and Both treatments have crab == "Y", while Control and Nutrient treatments have crab == "N" (string)
* nutrients: Whether we added nitrate to that colony (Y = yes, N = no). All Nutrient and Both treatments have nutrients == "Y", while Control and Crab treatments have nutrients == "N" (string)
* coral_vol_cm3: Volume of the coral colony in cubic centimeters, approximated using the equation for the volume of an ellipsoid (numeric)
* tissue_loss_5_percent: Approximate percent of a coral colony that experienced tissue loss at the end of 13 months. Estimates were made visually to the nearest 5% (integer)
* tissue_loss_binary: Whether a coral experienced any visible tissue loss (1) or not (0) (binary, 0 or 1)
* tbiden_1_month: The number of large (carapace >= 8 mm) *T. bidentata* on corals after 1 month of the experiment (integer)
* tbiden_13_month: The number of large (carapace >= 8 mm) *T. bidentata* on corals at the end of the experiment (integer)
* gmono_abundance: The abundance of *G. monodonta* on a coral at the end of 13 months (integer)
* gmono_density_per_1000cm3: The abundance of *G. monodonta* on a coral at the end of 13 months divided by coral_vol_cm3 and multiplied by 1,000 (numeric)
* dflav_abundance: The abundance of *D. flavicaudus* on a coral at the end of 13 months (integer)
* dflav_density_per_1000cm3: The abundance of *D. flavicaudus* on a coral at the end of 13 months divided by coral_vol_cm3 and multiplied by 1,000 (numeric)
