## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains the data and code required to replicate analyses in Renzi et al. (in prep). This dataset was collected as part of a 13-month long experiment in Moorea, French Polynesia examining the effects of nutrient enrichment on coral mutualists and coral health, which ran from 2021-2022. In the experiment we exposed 40 *Pocillopora* coral colonies (~20 cm diameter) to one of four treatments:

| Treatment        | Description           | Number of coral colonies  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Control      | No manipulation | 10 |
| Nutrient      | Slow-release nitrate fertilizer added      |   10 |
| Crab | Pair of heterosexual *T. bidentata* crabs added at the start of the experiment      |    10 |
| Both | Nitrate fertilizer and pair of crabs added      |    10 |

All corals were cleared of exosymbionts before the start of the experiment 


EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

### Permitting

All research was based out of the University of California Gump Research Station and conducted on the north shore of Moorea, a volcanic island in the Society Islands archipelago. Research was completed under permits issued by the Territorial Government of French Polynesia (Délégation à la Recherche) and the Haut-Commissariat de la République en Polynésie Francaise (DTRT). Coral tissue samples were transported under the Convention sur le commerce international des espèces de flore et de faune sauvages menaces d’extinction (CITES) export permit FR2198700097-E.

## Behavioral trials

#### File: crab\_feeding\_behavior.csv

*Behavioral trials*

**Description:** Results from video analysis of crab trials detailing the number of bites crabs took on different parts of an *A. aspera* coral. Videos were reviewed to determine the number of bites each crab took on live tissue, dead skeleton, and along the tissue loss margin in each trial. We defined a bite as any time a crab used a claw to scrape along the coral and then brought the claw to its mouth. Given that the margin between living and dead coral is a thin line, we defined *C. ungulatus* as feeding along the margin if its claw scraped across both live tissue and dead skeleton before bringing its claw to its mouth.

##### Variables

* Trial: Trial identifier
* Carapace_mm: Carapace length, in mm, of crab used in the trial
* Bites_alive: Number of bites taken on live coral tissue
* Bites_margin: Number of bites taken on the margin of live and dead

##### Variables

* Trial: Feeding video trial identifier
* Date: Date the trial was conducted
* Pixels^2: Pixel grid size set within ImageJ
* Alive_Pixels: Number of grid cross sections that fell on top of alive coral tissue
* Margin_Pixels: Number of grid cross sections that fell on top of the margin between alive and dead
* Dead_Pixels: Number of grid cross sections that fell on top of the zone of tissue loss

#### File: algal\_feeding\_trial.csv

*Behavioral trials*

**Description:** To test whether *C. ungulatus* reduces macroalgal biomass in tanks, we placed crabs in containers with macroalgae and monitored biomass removal over three days. Each algal clump was spun for 60 seconds and weighed before and after the trial to calculate biomass loss and percent biomass loss. Given that there were holes in each container to allow for water flow, we also ran 8 control trials to approximate background algal loss rate.

##### Variables

* Species: Whether there was a *Cyclodius* crab ("Cyclodius") in the container or not ("Control")
* Carapace_mm: Carapace width of the crab used in a trial if *Cyclodius* was added; NA indicates control
* Jar_number: Container identifier
* Initial_weight_g: Initial weight of the macroalgae in grams per trial
* Final_weight_g: Final weight of the macroalgae in grams per trial
