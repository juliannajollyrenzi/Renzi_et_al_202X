## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains the data and code required to replicate analyses in Renzi et al. (in prep). This dataset was collected as part of a 13-month long experiment in Moorea, French Polynesia examining the effects of nutrient enrichment on coral mutualists and coral health, which ran from 2021-2022. In the experiment we exposed *Pocillopora* coral colonies (~20 cm diameter) to one of four treatments:

| Treatment        | Description           | Number of coral colonies  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Control      | No manipulation | 10 |
| Nutrient      | Slow-release nitrate fertilizer added      |   10 |
| Crab | Pair of heterosexual *T. bidentata* crabs added at the start of the experiment      |    10 |
| Both | Nitrate fertilizer and a pair of *T. bidentata* crabs added      |    10 |

All corals were cleared of exosymbionts (i.e., coral-associated fishes and invertebrates) before the start of the experiment. Nutrient treatments consisted of 200 g of polymer-coated potassium nitrate (Multicote 12-0-44, Haifa Chemicals Ltd) per coral, which we refreshed every ~3 months. Water samples taken near diffusers confirmed the water coming out of diffusers were enriched. Crab treatments were not maintained and if crabs left colonies they were not replaced. Coral colonies (represented in the dataset using coral_ids 1-40) were blocked so that blocks ran perpendicular to the net flow direction to account for any recruitment shadows. Each block contained all 4 treatments in a random order (see schematic below, with rectangles representing a coral colony in a given treatment; Figure S1 in the associated manuscript). Coral #25 experienced 100% mortality during the experiment and is omitted from most analyses.

### Permitting

All research was based out of the University of California Gump Research Station and conducted on the north shore of Moorea, a volcanic island in the Society Islands archipelago. Research was completed under permits issued by the Territorial Government of French Polynesia (Délégation à la Recherche) and the Haut-Commissariat de la République en Polynésie Francaise (DTRT). Coral tissue samples were transported under the Convention sur le commerce international des espèces de flore et de faune sauvages menaces d’extinction (CITES) export permit FR2198700097-E.

- Bivalves (class Bivalvia)
- Brittle stars (class Ophiuroidea)

*Change in proteins, carbohydrates, and endosymbiont densities for experimental corals after 13 months*

**Description:** Change in protein content, change in carbohydrate content, and percent change in endosymbiont densities for experimental coral colonies, quantified from airbrushed coral tissue. Protein and carbohydrate content are calculated as a percentage of ash free dry weight. Change in protein and carbohydrate content is the protein/carbohydrate content for a coral at the end of the experiment minus the protein/carbohydrate content for that same coral at the start of the experiment. We quantified protein content using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit with bovine serum albumin standard with 3 technical replicates for each sample and standard. We quantified carbohydrate content using a sulfuric acid incubation and glucose standards (Masuko et al. 2005, Baumann et al. 2021) with 3 technical replicates. We quantified endosymbiont densities using a Marienfled 0.100 mm hemocytometer using established methods (Becker et al. 2021), which we normalized to coral surface area to get the number of endosymbiont cells per square centimeter of tissue. Coral surface area was calculated using standard wax dipping techniques. Percent change of endosymbiont densities was calculated as the endosymbiont density at the end of the experiment minus the density at the start of the experiment divided by the density at the start of the experiment.

Note: During data exploration we found that carbohydrate and protein content were linearly correlated with the surface area of the coral fragment. To deal with this correlation, we estimated the relationship between these metrics and fragment surface area in initial samples and subtracted the product of the slope of the line and fragment size from estimates to de-trend any effect of fragment size. The values in this file represent these adjusted values.

* protein_change: The difference between the final and starting protein content of a coral colony (numeric)
* carb_change: The difference between the final and starting carbohydrate content of a coral colony (numeric)
* endosym_percent_change: The percent change in endosymbiont density over the course of the experiment (numeric)

## File: water_nutrients.csv

*Nitrogen concentration of water near diffusers versus controls*

**Description:** We measured the water near nutrient diffusers and near colonies without nutrient diffusers to quantify whether diffusers were enriching the local seawater. To this end, we collected 60 mL of seawater near 10 randomly chosen colonies with diffusers or near 10 randomly chosen colonies without diffusers. Samples were then filtered (GF/F) into sterile tubes, frozen, and analyzed at the University of California Marine Science Analytical Laboratory. We sampled water 4 days after refreshing nutrients and 1 month afterwards.

#### Variables

* coral_id: Unique coral colony identifier used in the experiment. Coral identifiers range from 1-40 and are consistent across datasets (numeric; 1-40)
* timepoint: Whether the water sample is from 4 days (timepoint = 1) or 1 month (timepoint = 2) after nutrients addition (integer/factor)
* nitrite_nitrate_umol: Concentration of nitrate + nitrite in seawater in µmol (numeric)
* nitrite_nitrate_belowlimit: Whether the sample was below the analytical detection threshold (0.20 µmol; Y = below the limit, N = not below the limit) (string)
